## How to contribute?
If you would like to contribute, clone the repository locally or download the file you would like to edit. 

Start working on the translations.

Using AI for translations is fine, but we welcome a human review, especially for tag and category names, to ensure accuracy.

**Please only submit translations which you reviewed for accuracy.**

The translations of the heads are ordered by occurrences, so the earlier they appear in the file, the more often they're used.

If you downloaded the file instead of cloning the repository, please send us your changes in Discord, so we can implement them back in the repository.
