New languages are possible ofc. Just let us know so we can initiate it.

Using AI for translations is fine, but we welcome a human review, especially for tag and category names, to ensure accuracy.

The translations of the heads are ordered by occurrences, so the earlier they appear in the file, the more important their accuracy.
